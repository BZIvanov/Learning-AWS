      <h2>ElasticBeanstalk</h2>
      <p>
        ElasticBeanstalk is about deploying our applications on AWS.
        ElasticBeanstalk is managed service and in general what it does for us
        is automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling,
        health monitoring, instance configuration, etc...
      </p>

        <h3>Deployment Modes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Single instance - good for development</li>
          <li>High availability with Load Balancer - good for production</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Deployment options for updates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All at once - fastest option, but instances are not available while
            the downtime for update
          </li>
          <li>
            Rolling update - update few instances at a time and then move to the
            next bucket once the first one is healthy
          </li>
          <li>
            Rolling with additional batches - like rolling, but spins up new
            instances to move the batch (this way the old application is still
            available)
          </li>
          <li>
            Immutable - spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys version to
            these instances and then swaps all the instances when everything is
            healthy
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h3>Lifecycle Policy</h3>
      <p>ElasticBeanstalk can store at most 1000 application versions.</p>
      <p>
        We can phase out (remove) versions by using lifecycle policy. They can
        be 2 types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>based on time - old versions are removed</li>
        <li>based on space - when we have too many versions</li>
      </ul>
