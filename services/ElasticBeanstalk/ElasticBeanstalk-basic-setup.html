            <b>Create Application</b>

          <p>
            For this simple demo we don't have our own code so we will create
            some default.

          <p>
            Now you have your new application and environment created for you.
            Note that this will also create EC2 instance, Security Groups, S3
            bucket etc., so you will also need to remove them if you don't want
            to use the create application anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the menu on the left you can more info about details for the
            application.
