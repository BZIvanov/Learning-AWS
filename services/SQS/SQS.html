      <h2>SQS - Simple Queue Service</h2>
      <p>
        SQS is good for decoupling applications. The sender to the queue is the
        Producer (first app) and receiver from the queue is the Consumer (second
        app).
      </p>
      <p>
        Default retention period (the time we store the message in the queue) is
        4 days with optional maximum of 14 days.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Access policy</h3>
      <p>Similarly to S3, SQS also have its own access policies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cross account access</li>
        <li>Publish S3 event notifications to SQS</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Message visibility timeout</h3>
      <p>
        After a message is polled by a consumer, it becomes invisible to other
        consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default the message is invisible for 30 seconds, which means that we
        have to process it in 30 seconds.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Dead letter queue (DLQ)</h3>
      <p>
        If the consumer fails to process the message and 30 seconds of
        invibility expired the message will be returned to the queue (become
        visible again). With DLQ we can control how many times we will return
        the message back to queue. This is useful, because if we keep failing
        with processing the message, there is the chance that something is wrong
        with the message and we should stop trying.
