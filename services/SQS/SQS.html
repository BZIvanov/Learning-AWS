      <h2>SQS - Simple Queue Service</h2>
      <p>
        SQS is good for decoupling applications. The sender to the queue is the
        Producer (first app) and receiver from the queue is the Consumer (second
        app).
      </p>
      <p>
        Default retention period (the time we store the message in the queue) is
        4 days with optional maximum of 14 days.
