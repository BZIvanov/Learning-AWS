      <p>
        CloudTrail provides governance, compliance and audit for our AWS
        account. It is enabled by default. For example if one instance of
        something is deleted on our account we can check who did it.
      </p>
      <p>
        With CT we can get history of events, API calls made by using Console,
        SDK, CLI or AWS services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Events are stored by default for 90 days. If we want to have them for
        longer we can log them to S3 and then further analyze them using Athena.
