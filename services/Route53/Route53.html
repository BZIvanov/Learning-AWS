      <h2>Route53</h2>
      <p>Route53 is managed DNS (Domain Name System)</p>
      <p>
        DNS is collection of rules and records which help clients to understand
        how to reach a server through its domain name.

      <h3>Record Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>A</b> - hostname to IPv4</li>
        <li><b>AAAA</b> - hostname to IPv6</li>
        <li><b>CNAME</b> - hostname to hostname</li>
        <li><b>NS</b> - name servers for the hosted zone</li>

      <h3>Routing policies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple routing - route traffic to a single resource</li>
        <li>
          Weighted - control percent of the requests going to specific AWS
          resource. Different wights are assigned to different records.
        </li>
        <li>
          Geolocation - based on user location. For example we can redirect
          users from Spain to one IP and users from Italy to another IP. We can
          also specify Default case for all the others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Latency - redirects to resource, that has the least latency close to
          us
        </li>
        <li>Failover - it is based on Health checks</li>
        <li>Multivalue answer - routing to multiple resources</li>
      </ul>
