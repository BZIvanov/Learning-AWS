# SNS

SNS (Simple Notifications Service) allows us to work with notifications.

- S3 allows us to store objects (files) in _buckets_ (directories)
- _Buckets_ must have a globally unique name and they are defined at the region level. S3 basically S3 is a global service, but the buckets are placed in different regions.
