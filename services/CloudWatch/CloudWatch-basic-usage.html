            Here we will check an example with console.log coming from a lambda
            function. Click <b>Log groups</b> under <b>Logs</b>. Click the
            lambda function execution details. Note that for this example we
            have lambda function console.logging some text and we have executed
            it already to have some logs which we can check
          </p>

          <p>
            You will see stream of logs, if you have multiple select the latest.
            On the below screenshot you can see after the INFO, the text our
            lambda function is console.logging everytime the function is
            executed
