      <h2>EBS - Elastic Block Store</h2>
      <p>EBS is a network drive working similarly to the USB sticks</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you can attach on an instance while it is running</li>
        <li>persist data even after termination of the EC2 instance</li>
        <li>can be mounted to 1 instance at a time</li>
        <li>it can detached from 1 instance and attached to another</li>
        <li>
          it's locked to Availability Zone (AZ), for example you can't use from
          us-east-1a to us-east-1b
        </li>
        <li>
          before detaching EBS volumes it is recommended, not necessary to
          create a snapshot
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        One way to explain EBS with analogy is if EC2 is virtual server, then
        EBS is virtual disk.

      <h3>EBS volume types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          General purpose SSD (GP2) - balances both proce and performance. Good
          for less than 10000 IOPS requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provisioned IOPS SSD (I01) - good for intensive I/O applications such
          as large relational or NoSQL databases. Good for 10000-20000 IOPS
          requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Throughput optimized HDD (ST1) - good for big data, data warehouse,
          log processing. It cannot be a boot volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cold HDD (SC1) - good for low cost storage for infrequently accessed
          workloads. It cannot be a boot volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Magnetic (Standard) - lowest cost per gigabyte option, which is
          bootable. This is a legacy option.
        </li>
      </ul>
