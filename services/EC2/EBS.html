      <h2>EBS - Elastic Block Store</h2>
      <p>EBS is a network drive working similarly to the USB sticks</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you can attach on an instance while it is running</li>
        <li>persist data even after termination of the EC2 instance</li>
        <li>can be mounted to 1 instance at a time</li>
        <li>it can be detached from 1 instance and attached to another</li>
        <li>
          it's locked to Availability Zone (AZ), for example you can't use from
          us-east-1a to us-east-1b
        </li>
        <li>
          before detaching EBS volumes it is recommended, not necessary to
          create a snapshot
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Snapshots</h3>
      <p>
        We can create snapshots from our EBS volumes. Snapshot is also useful if
        we want to move EBS volume from one AZ to another, we do that by just
        creating new volume based on the snapshot. We can also copy snapshots
        across regions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        One way to explain EBS with analogy is if EC2 is virtual server, then
        EBS is virtual disk.

      <h3>EBS volume types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          General purpose SSD (GP2/GP3) - balances both proce and performance.
          Good for less than 16000 IOPS requirements, the baseline is 3000 IOPS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1/IO2) - good for intensive I/O applications
          such as large relational or NoSQL databases. Good for 16000+ IOPS
          requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Throughput optimized HDD (ST1) - good for big data, data warehouse,
          log processing. It cannot be a boot volume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cold HDD (SC1) - good for low cost storage for infrequently accessed
          workloads. It cannot be a boot volume.
        </li>
      </ul>
