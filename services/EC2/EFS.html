      <h2>EFS - Elastic File System</h2>
      <p>
        We can connect different EC2 instances from different regions to the
        same EFS. So for example they will have access to the same files on the
        file system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>EFS works with EC2 instances from multiple Availability zones</li>
        <li>only works with Linux</li>
        <li>accessible with security groups</li>
      </ul>
