      <h3>OS options</h3>

        choice is Linux.

      <h3>Security groups</h3>
      <p>
        SGs control how the traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances.
        They can reference by IP or by another Security group.
      </p>
      <p>One SG can be attached to multiple EC2 instances.</p>
      <p>
        If our application is not accessible (timeout) it means it is most
        likely security group issue. And if the connection is refused it is
        probably application error or it is not launched.
