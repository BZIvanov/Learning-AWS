      <h3>Main points in IAM are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Users - usually physical person</li>
        <li>
          Groups - Could be admins, devops, etc... Groups only contain users,
          not another groups. One user can be in more than 1 group.
        </li>
        <li>
          Policies - they define what each of the 2 above can do. Can be
          <b>Allow</b> or <b>Deny</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Roles - internal usage with AWS resources. Also collection of
          policies, for example ("SNS:CreateTopic", "SNS:Subscribe"). Roles are
          similar to policies, they define what services are allowed to do
          similarly like what users are allowed to do by policies. Common roles
          are EC2 instance roles, Lambda function roles, with the roles this
          services are allowed to do some actions.
