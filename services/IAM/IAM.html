    <div>
      <p>Main points in IAM are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users - usually physical person</li>
        <li>
          Groups - Could be admins, devops etc. Groups only contain users, not
          another groups. One user can be in more than 1 group
        </li>
        <li>
          Policies - they define what each of the 3 above can do. Can be
          <b>Allow</b> or <b>Deny</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Roles - internal usage with AWS resources. Also collection of
          policies, for example ("SNS:CreateTopic", "SNS:Subscribe"). Roles are
          similar to policies, they define what services are allowed to do
          similarly like what users are allowed to do by policies
        </li>
      </ul>
