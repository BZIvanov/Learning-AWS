      <h2>Basic usage</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Click <b>Users</b> from the menu on the left, then <b>Add User</b>
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/new-user.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fill the following information. The 4th step is just to review the
            selection from the previous steps. Download the csv file on the 5th
            step
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/create-user.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/create-user-2.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/create-user-3.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/create-user-4.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Now you can see your new user in the <b>Users</b> section</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Next step is to create a group. Click <b>Groups</b> from the menu on
            the left, then <b>Create new group</b> button
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/new-group.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Give it a name. Attach policies you need. Third step is to review
            the selection so just click <b>Create New Group</b>
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/create-group.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/create-group-2.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now you can find your groups in the <b>Groups</b> section. Click it
            to add users in the group. From the <b>Users</b> tab click
            <b>Add Users to Group</b>, check all the users you want to add and
            click <b>Add Users</b>
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/add-to-group.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/add-to-group-2.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now after we have added our user to our admin group the user will
            inherit all of the admin group permissions. So we can go back to
            user's permission and remove <b>Administrator access</b> because he
            will inherit it from the group and if we in future remove the user
            from the admin group he will automatically lose the admin rights
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/attached-directly.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <p>
            <b>Attached directly</b> policies are also hard to manage, because
            they go with the specific user, not on a group level
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Something also good to do is to update password policy for all IAM
            users. Click <b>Account settings</b> from the menu on the left, then
            click <b>Change password policy</b>
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/password-policy.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Set the requirements for the policy which each user must follow,
            when setting up a password. And click <b>Save changes</b>
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/password-settings.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            And because we don't want to use the root account we will also use
            alias
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/use-alias.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/create-alias.PNG" alt="drawing" />
          <img src="./pics/new-alias.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Now we can use that new alias URL to log in with it</p>
          <img src="./pics/login.PNG" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reset your password now, because this is requirement for our IAM
            users
          </p>
          <img src="./pics/password-reset.png" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>And now you will be logged in with your new user</p>
          <img src="./pics/new-login.png" alt="drawing" />
        </li>
        <li>
          That's it, now you have admin user which you can use instead of your
          root user account, also alias replacing the account as a number
        </li>
        <li>
          One more thing is to also set MFA for this new user. To do that click
          your username (top-right on the screen) and from the drop down select
          <b>My security credentials</b>. Then <b>Assign MFA device</b>, then
          <b>Virtual MFA device</b>. Scan the QR code and finish the process
        </li>
      </ol>
