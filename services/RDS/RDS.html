      <h2>RDS - Relational Database Service</h2>
      <p>
        Big advantage of using RDS is the storage auto scaling. If we are
        running out of storage it will be increased automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>Data recovery types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated backups</li>
        <li>
          Snapshots - they are done manually and are still kept after we delete
          the RDS instance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Multi AZ RDS</h3>
      <p>
        Multi AZ allows us to have the exact copy of our DB in another AZ. In
        case of some disaster automatically to copy will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intention of Multi AZ is for disaster recovery, not performance
        improvements. For performance improvements we would use Read Replicas.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Read Replica</h3>
      <p>
        RR allows us to have read-only copy of our production database. This is
        achieved by using async replication from our primary RDS instance to the
        read replica.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read Replicas can be promoted to be a database. This breaks the
        replication.
      </p>
      <p>Each RR will have its own DNS endpoint.</p>
      <p>
        We can have up to 5 RRs. They can be within the same AZ, Cross AZ or
        Cross Region.
      </p>

      <h3>Encryption</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>At rest encryption</h4>
        <p>
          Encryption has to be defined at launch time. If the master is not
          encrypted the read replicas also cannot be encrypted.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>In-flight encryption</h4>
        <p>Encryption is done with SSL certificates.</p>
