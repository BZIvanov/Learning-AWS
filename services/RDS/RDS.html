      <h3>Data recovery types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated backups</li>
        <li>
          Snapshots - they are done manually and are still kept after we delete
          the RDS instance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Multi AZ RDS</h3>
      <p>
        Multi AZ allows us to have the exact copy of our DB in another AZ. In
        case of some disaster automatically to copy will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intention of Multi AZ is for disaster recovery, not performance
        improvements. For performance improvements we would use Read Replicas.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Read Replica</h3>
      <p>
        RR allows us to have read-only copy of our production database. This is
        achieved by using async replication from our primary RDS instance to the
        read replica.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read Replicas can be promoted to be a database. This breaks the
        replication.
      </p>
      <p>Each RR will have its own DNS endpoint.</p>
