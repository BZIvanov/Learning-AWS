      <h2>VPC - Virtual Private Cloud</h2>
      <p>VPC is private network where we can deploy our resources</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing</h2>
      <p>
        It is a method for efficiently allocating and specifying IP addresses
        and routing them on the Internet. It is notation to specify IP address
        ranges for virtual networks, subnets, and other resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have an IP address range starting at 192.168.0.0 and
        want to allocate 256 addresses, the CIDR notation would be
        192.168.0.0/24. Here, the "/24" indicates that the first 24 bits of the
        IP address are fixed as the network address, leaving 8 bits for host
        addresses (2^8 = 256).
      </p>

      <h3>Subnets</h3>
      <p>Subnets allow us to partition our network inside the VPC</p>
      <p>Public subnet is a subnet which is accessible from internet</p>
      <p>Private subnet is a subnet which is not accessible from internet</p>
      <p>
        Access from internet and between subnets is defined in
        <b>Route Tables</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Internet Gateway and NAT Gateways</h3>
      <p>
        Internet Gateways provide us a way to access our VPC from internet.
        Public subnets have a route to the internet gateway
      </p>
      <p>
        NAT Gateways and NAT Instances provide us a way our Private Subnets to
        access internet while remaining private.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>VPC Peering</h3>
      <p>
        Connect two VPC privately using AWS's network. It makes them to behave
        like they are the same network.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>VPC Endpoints</h3>
      <p>
        VPC Endpoints provide private access to AWS service (for example S3,
        SNS, etc...) within VPC so we don't have to use the public internet.
      </p>
      <h4>Endpoint types</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Interface endpoints</li>
        <li>Gateway endpoints</li>
