# AWS-SDK

SDK provide us a way to access any aws service programatically. We don't need to install the sdk if we are using it directly in aws, we would need the install if we are using it on our machine for example.

[Here](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/) you can find more info on how to use aws-sdk with javascript.

[Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/index.html) you can find documentation for each service and how to use.
